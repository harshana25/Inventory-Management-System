# **Introduction**

With the rapid spread of Covid 19 Pandemic disease worldwide, there has been a huge decline in every industryâ€™s development throughout the world. So, the entrepreneurs happened to involve in a new type of income-earning with the challenge of the pandemic. As a result, almost all the leading companies in the world paid attention to reducing the cost and obtaining a profit against it because of having limitations on industries. In early times most of the companies in Sri Lanka managed their inventories manually. It was a huge, complicated procedure to handle them manually and a difficult task to identify the exact expenses of the operational working flows. Every month-end they had got trouble balancing their inventories because of not having a proper computerized system.
As a proposed solution to the above couple of challenges, the need for a new system arose. Concerning that, a computerized Inventory Management system was introduced to said client Nation Development Bank to manage their consumption of office suppliers and fulfil the management decisions taken to reduce the cost of the bank.

# **The objectives of the project are as follows.**

*	To manage the User Accesses.
+	To generate month-end reports
-	Ability to balance the stocks.
*	To keep the records of availability and non-availability stocks.
